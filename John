I once had a Beagle who lived with me called John.
He was always the first to wake up at dawn.
He was loyal and obedient or so I thought.
Until the day he commited a crime on which he was caught.

The crime was horrible and I was determined to punish the offender.
I investigated everyone around me.
I questioned my Dad.I asked my Mom.
I accused my little brother only to realize I was wrong.
The case did'nt close until sun down.

 As the day ended John's plan commmenced.
 He left the house in the dead of night with much ease.
 With something in his mouth he ran with the brezze.
 Finally John Reached his destination it was a sight to behold.
 
 In the ally way in the middle of town. 
 John and his buddies had obtained a pile
 A pile of what you may wonder.
 It was a pile of shoes.
 They weree from Adidas to Nikes.
 Which were torn through like they had nothing to lose.
 
 That was the day my favorite pair of shoes were torn.
 John forever I would scorn.
 Now John does'nt live with us anymore.
 You won't hear the snores of a dog after sunset.
 
 After this tragedy would I look out my window at night.
 At a new dog doghose in my backlawn.
 Inside layed  an offender of an unforgivable crime.
 Inside slept a dog called John.
