I once had a Beagle called John.
He was always the first to wake up at dawn.
He was loyal and obedient or so I thought.
Every thing changed when he made a mess of my homework.

I investigated everyone around me.
I questioned my Dad.I asked my Mom.

But the culprit to this problem was nowhere to be seen.
